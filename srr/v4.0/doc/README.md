Hi,

The script is distributed with DPM, you can find it here:

https://gitlab.cern.ch/lcgdm/dmlite/blob/develop/shell/src/dpm-storage-summary.py

It was based on this "schema":

https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/LCG/AccountingTaskForce/storage_service_v4.txt

Having a definitive json schema we could validate against would be useful.

Cheers,

Oliver.
